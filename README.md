## Bitcoin Price Notification script

A simple script made using python. 

## What It Will Do?

- Tracks the bitcoin price for every _ minutes and stores it in a list.
- When the list gets filled, it will send the data to your telegram app.
- If the bitcoin price falls below a certain `threshold` value, then it will send an immediate telegram message.

## To Make It Work...

To make this script work, you will need the following:

- <a href="https://pro.coinmarketcap.com/" target="_blank">coinmarketcap.com</a> api token
- A [telegram bot](https://core.telegram.org/bots#6-botfather) and it's `token`.
- Your telegram account's `chat_id`
- And Python3!
